# README Template

# :eyes: About
This project is an example template for README.md files in GitHub projects. GitHub readme files should contain enough information at first glance that a person (maybee even your future self) can quickly understand the purpose of the project. In this about section, include a HIGH level description. Keep it short... reading be tough :cold_sweat:.

  ### Highlights

  In the [about](#üëÄ-about) section, a very high level description of the application was given. Here is an opportunity to give more details on specific aspects of the app. Keep the highlights at a level everyone can understand. More technical details can be added below or in seperate README files in the same repository. The goal of a good README is to provide clear documentation so that a developer can get everything they need to start using this repository without having to ask for assitance.

  ### Environment URLs
  
  If applicable, give urls for the different environments where this application can be used/seen.
